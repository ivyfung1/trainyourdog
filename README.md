# Train Your Dog
Don't own a dragon?! No problem, a dog is more accessible anyway. A virtual one is even easier. Get yours and start training it. But wait, let's build the school first. Or maybe, let's start with train-the-trainer. Yes, you, the human!

## The Idea
Reference made to a [use case](https://github.com/ivyfung1/syllabus/blob/master/Applying%20NEM.md#topic-3-escrow-services) I made up for NIS1. Now, with Symbol Testnet is up, it would be a good time to make the next version of it. 

## The Game
It is very simple. Create an account, buy a dog, name it, groom it, train it, breed it, sign it up for a tournament (hmm racing? maybe), sell it, and PLEASE, just don't kill it. 

## The Platform
This dog training school will be built on Symbol Testnet. I have not have a name for the school yet, and I reserve the honor to name it. 

## The Fuctions and the Features
### Non-fungible digitised identity
Both the owner and the dogs are considered non-fungible identities that will be represented by an account with metadata attached to it to give it more recocnisable, and with more characteristics. 

### Skillsets
Each skillset is represented by a mosaic. The more mosaic an account (representing a dog) has, the more skilled the dog is. These mosaics shall only be able to transfer to an account representing a dog using mosaic restriction, and it shall be non-transferrable. 

### Ownership
An account (owner) can only own another account (a dog) if it is a multisig account, and the owner is the cosignator (custodian).
